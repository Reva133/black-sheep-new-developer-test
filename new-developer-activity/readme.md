# BSC New Developer Activity

## Instructions:

You will have 2 hours to complete this task, please take your time to read the brief. 

This repo has all the assets and some basic html.

Grab that and complete the design found in Figma [here is the link](https://www.figma.com/file/uKk8rgk87DyvMv67EsANTc/New-Dev-Frontend?node-id=0%3A1).

Try to do each thing well, itâ€™s better to have half done perfectly, than rush it.

Submit a link to a public repo with your attempt or zip it up and email it through.

## Brief

Hello new developer, we have a project that was started by one of our developers, they are now on holiday and the client has just moved up their "Go Live" date to 29th of April 2022, which means we need to get this website completed ASAP.

Do not fear, most of the website is done, you just need to add the final pieces.

#### **Instructions left from previous developer**

Hey buddy, I have completed most of the bulk of the site, I didn't use any fancy libraries like React or Tailwind for this project so it should be easy for you. 

I have not touched the mobile responsiveness and I know the client really wanted that, there is some sections I haven't completed if you could just look around and add them. 

The password the client wanted was "BSCDental" I know super secure right... The clients marketing team wanted the website to go public 2 weeks after we have "gone live" make the countdown timer end two weeks from the 29th of April 2022.

Just bare in mind I am not very good with FrontEnd Development, I prefer backend so please fix anything you think is wrong <3 

Best of luck, I will be back 2 days before the go live to review the code you write.
